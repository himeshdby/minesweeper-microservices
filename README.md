# Minesweeper Microservices Project (Java 17)

## Modules

- **minesweeper-game**: Core minesweeper logic and model.
- **minesweeper-cli**: CLI simulation (user-facing).
- **Tests**: Demonstrate success and failure gameplay.

## Requirements

- Java 17+
- Maven 3.8+

## Build

```sh
mvn clean install
```

## Run (CLI)

```sh
cd minesweeper-cli
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.minesweeper.cli.MinesweeperCLI"
```
## Game play

### Sucess example
```
Welcome to Minesweeper!

Enter the size of the grid (e.g. 4 for a 4x4 grid): 
4
Enter the number of mines to place on the grid (maximum is 35% of the total squares): 
3

Here is your minefield:
  1 2 3 4
A _ _ _ _
B _ _ _ _
C _ _ _ _
D _ _ _ _

Select a square to reveal (e.g. A1): D4
This square contains 0 adjacent mines. 

Here is your updated minefield:
  1 2 3 4
A _ _ 2 0
B _ _ 2 0
C _ 2 1 0
D _ 1 0 0

Select a square to reveal (e.g. A1): B1
This square contains 3 adjacent mines. 

Here is your updated minefield:
  1 2 3 4
A _ _ 2 0
B 3 _ 2 0
C _ 2 1 0
D _ 1 0 0

Select a square to reveal (e.g. A1): A1
This square contains 2 adjacent mines. 

Here is your updated minefield:
  1 2 3 4
A 2 _ 2 0
B 3 _ 2 0
C _ 2 1 0
D _ 1 0 0

Select a square to reveal (e.g. A1): D1
This square contains 1 adjacent mines. 

Here is your updated minefield:
  1 2 3 4
A 2 _ 2 0
B 3 _ 2 0
C _ 2 1 0
D 1 1 0 0

## Tests

```sh
mvn test
```

## Design & Assumptions

- Microservices simulated via Maven modules (for demonstration).
- CLI accepts scripted moves for automatic testing.
- Mines placed randomly, but can be seeded for repeatable tests.
- Follows clean code, OOP, and SOLID principles.
